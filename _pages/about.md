<!-- My research interests are mainly focused on __Computer Vision__ using __Deep Learning__ methods.

I'm passionate about studying ways to make neural systems evolve over time, incorporating new data and leveraging existing knowledge from already trained models to solve new problems.

This involves building on existing techniques in meta-learning, continual learning and neural architecture search to improve performances on __classification, object detection and instance segmentation__ tasks. -->

I specialize in applying **Deep Learning** methods to **Computer Vision**, with a keen interest in enhancing neural systems' adaptability and performance over time. My passion lies in exploring practical solutions to make models evolve over time, integrating new data, and leveraging existing knowledge for efficient real-world problem-solving. 

In my research, I am adept at utilizing **meta-learning, continual learning, and neural architecture search** techniques to optimize performance under budget constraints across classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks. 

My goal is to leverage my research and engineering skills to help **bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and industrial applications**.
