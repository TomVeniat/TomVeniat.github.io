  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  title={Learning time/memory-efficient deep architectures with budgeted super networks},
  author={Veniat, Tom and Denoyer, Ludovic},
  journal={IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)},
  year={2018},
  month={June},
  abstract={We propose to focus on the problem of discovering neural network architectures efficient in terms of both prediction quality and cost. For instance, our approach is able to solve the following tasks: learn a neural network able to predict well in less than 100 milliseconds or learn an efficient model that fits in a 50 Mb memory. Our contribution is a novel family of models called Budgeted Super Networks (BSN). They are learned using gradient descent techniques applied on a budgeted learning objective function which integrates a maximum authorized cost, while making no assumption on the nature of this cost. We present a set of experiments on computer vision problems and analyze the ability of our technique to deal with three different costs: the computation cost, the memory consumption cost and a distributed computation cost. We particularly show that our model can discover neural network architectures that have a better accuracy than the ResNet and Convolutional Neural Fabrics architectures on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, at a lower cost.}

  title={Stochastic adaptive neural architecture search for keyword spotting},
  author={V{\'e}niat, Tom and Schwander, Olivier and Denoyer, Ludovic},
  journal={IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)},
  year={2019},
  month={May},
  abstract={The problem of keyword spotting i.e. identifying keywords in a real-time audio stream is mainly solved by applying a neural network over successive sliding windows. Due to the difficulty of the task, baseline models are usually large, resulting in a high computational cost and energy consumption level. We propose a new method called SANAS (Stochastic Adaptive Neural Architecture Search) which is able to adapt the architecture of the neural network on-the-fly at inference time such that small architectures will be used when the stream is easy to process (silence, low noise, ...) and bigger networks will be used when the task becomes more difficult. We show that this adaptive model can be learned end-to-end by optimizing a trade-off between the prediction performance and the average computational cost per unit of time. Experiments on the Speech Commands dataset show that this approach leads to a high recognition level while being much faster (and/or energy saving) than classical approaches where the network architecture is static.}

  title={Efficient continual learning with modular networks and task-driven priors},
  author={Veniat, Tom and Denoyer, Ludovic and Ranzato, Marc'Aurelio},
  journal={International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR)},
  year={2021},
  month={May},
  abstract={Existing literature in Continual Learning (CL) has focused on overcoming catastrophic forgetting, the inability of the learner to recall how to perform tasks observed in the past. There are however other desirable properties of a CL system, such as the ability to transfer knowledge from previous tasks and to scale memory and compute sub-linearly with the number of tasks. Since most current benchmarks focus only on forgetting using short streams of tasks, we first propose a new suite of benchmarks to probe CL algorithms across these new axes. Finally, we introduce a new modular architecture, whose modules represent atomic skills that can be composed to perform a certain task. Learning a task reduces to figuring out which past modules to re-use, and which new modules to instantiate to solve the current task. Our learning algorithm leverages a task-driven prior over the exponential search space of all possible ways to combine modules, enabling efficient learning on long streams of tasks. Our experiments show that this modular architecture and learning algorithm perform competitively on widely used CL benchmarks while yielding superior performance on the more challenging benchmarks we introduce in this work. }
