My research interests are mainly focused on __Computer Vision__ using __Deep Learning__ methods.

I'm passionate about studying ways to make neural systems evolve over time, incorporating new data and leveraging existing knowledge from already trained models to solve new problems.

This involves building on existing techniques in meta-learning, continual learning and neural architecture search to improve performances on __classification, object detection and instance segmentation__ tasks.
