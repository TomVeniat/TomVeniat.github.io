I successfully defended my PhD on Neural Architecture Search (NAS) under Budget Constraints. My primary contributions include the development of supervised and continual learning algorithms capable of identifying efficient architectures, considering factors such as compute time, memory footprint, and adaptability to scenarios with limited data availability.
